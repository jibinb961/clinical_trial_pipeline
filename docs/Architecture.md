So here is my final architecture, 
 my source code is fully on Github, and it has a ci pipeline that when a code change happens, it runs the pipeline, which builds  a docker image out of the source code and push to Google Artifact Registry , so that we have the latest docker image all the time, at the artifact registry which can be used for deployment. 

Now coming to the orchestrator, I am self hosting a prefect server on Render,since prefect is open source,  with a postgresql database for persistent storage, the service is active all the time, and I have created a cloud run work- pool in that, which can spin up a Cloud Run Job on GCP with the latest docker image that we have built using the gihutb CI pipeline,  when a run is scheduled.

Workflow, 
When a run is scheduled on my custom hosted prefect server, it can deploy a Google Cloud Run Job, that will spin up a container on demand, and runs the pipeline with te parameters that it receives from he prefect cloud, it uses Clinical_Trials.gov API to fetch all the clinical trials for a disease,( specified in the parameters) , extracts all the trials and pulls drug information from all these trials, enriches them for modality and target. It uses a .sqlite cache table hosted in Google Cloud Storage Bucket, and it retrieves that bucket in the beginning of the pipeline, Then if the information is not found in the Cache, it retrieves the modality and target of drugs, using CHEMBL API fuzzy matching, and if it coudlnt find the information bout a drug, it will fallback to Google GEMINI for further search, then all this results are saved back to the .sqllite cache file  stored in Google Cloud Storage Bucket. Now a data frame is created with all the transformed columns, and visualizations are created and exported to Run specific folders in Google Cloud Storage. Then A streamlit application is used to visualize the plots retrieved from the Google Storage bucket for a run. 

Now I need you to create a workflow diagram for this, including a notion document that explain the workflow in detail, if possible give me mermaid diagram graph as well. 
Overall how do you tink my pipeline is ?
